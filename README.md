## FlyballETS-Software

The [Flyball ETS project](https://sparkydevices.wordpress.com/tag/flyball-ets/) contains the sources for the microcontroller software.

## Source files

The source files are divided into 2 subdirectories:

### Firmware

This folder contains the sources for compiling the firmware which is to be flashed onto the ESP32 MCU.
It uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) to manage the board library, as well as other libraries needed.

### WebUI

This folder contains the angular sources for building the web interface used to control the system.
They need to be built first because they output a header file to the `Firmware` folder which is needed in order to compile the firmware.
Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, then run the following commands in the `WebUI` folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
APPLE USERS!!!
In iOS 15 Safari setting => Advanced => Experimental Features => NSURLSession WebSocket is default On. It has to be turned Off, otherwise WebUI will be crashing.

## Thanks

This project was made possible by the following awesome libraries/projects and their developers:

- [TinyGPS++](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/tinygpsplus/) for interacting with the GPS module
- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) for easily building JSON objects in Arduino
- [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) for providing a very powerful and featured webserver & websocket interface
- [Arduino core SDK for ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) for being able to use the ESP32 platform at all
- [Embedis](https://github.com/thingSoC/embedis) for providing an easy to use EEPROM interface to store settings
- [NeoPixelBus](https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus) for reliably controlling WS2812 LEDs using ESP32
- [Espurna Project](https://bitbucket.org/xoseperez/espurna) was used as a great example to solve several problems, such as the web UI and the settings interface.
